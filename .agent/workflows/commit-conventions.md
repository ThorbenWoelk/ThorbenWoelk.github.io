# Conventional Commits Specification

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.

## Structure
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types
- **fix**: patches a bug in your codebase.
- **feat**: introduces a new feature to the codebase.
- **build**: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
- **chore**: technical/maintenance tasks not modifying src or test.
- **ci**: changes to CI configuration.
- **docs**: documentation only changes.
- **style**: formatting, missing semi-colons, etc (no logic change).
- **refactor**: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **perf**: code change that improves performance.
- **test**: adding/correcting tests.

## Examples
- `feat(ui): add multi-select filter`
- `fix: resolve racing condition in auth flow`
- `docs: update deployment instructions`
- `feat!: breaking change with exclamation mark`
