## Language Style Guide: Professional Communication

When drafting cover letters, documentation, or other professional communications:

- **Tone & Voice**: Maintain a professional, direct, and concise tone. 
- **Avoid Euphoria**: Avoid overly enthusiastic or "euphoric" language (e.g., "I'm thrilled," "extraordinary opportunity," "I read with a smile"). Stick to factual expressions of interest and qualification.
- **Punctuation**: NEVER use em dashes (—). Use simple dashes (-) instead.
- **Brevity**: Focus on high-impact information. Remove filler words and redundant adjectives.
